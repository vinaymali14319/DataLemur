Write a query to list the candidates who possess all of the required skills for the job. Sort the the output by candidate ID in ascending order.

Assumption:

There are no duplicates in the candidates table.
candidates Table:
Column Name	Type
candidate_id	integer
skill	varchar
candidates Example Input:
candidate_id	skill
123	Python
123	Tableau
123	PostgreSQL
234	R
234	PowerBI
234	SQL Server
345	Python
345	Tableau
Example Output:
candidate_id
123
Explanation
Candidate 123 is displayed because they have Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL skills. 345 isn't included in the output because they're missing one of the required skills: PostgreSQL.


Solution:

SELECT candidate_id FROM candidates where skill in ('Python','Tableau','PostgreSQL')

GROUP BY candidate_id HAVING COUNT(candidate_id) = 3  ORDER BY candidate_id ASC
